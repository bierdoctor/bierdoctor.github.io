**Digital Footprints:**
Each of us intentionally and unintentionally leaves behind digital information traces, our “digital footprint”, as we go about our daily lives. This undergraduate course provides a high-level overview of the different kinds of technologies involved in capturing this information, who owns it and controls it, and how it is used to both make our lives easier and at the same time more publicly visible. The goal is to increase awareness of what others can learn about you through these digital traces, to think about what we might be gaining (and losing) as individuals and society by allowing our digital footprints to continue to expand, and to debate what future technologies and policies concerning this information should be like.

**Fundamentals of HCI:**
This Master’s-level course introduces graduate students to the interdisciplinary field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI). We will be exploring wide-ranging themes and principles behind 30+ years of research and practice in this applied field, concerned with such topics as networked environments, social and mobile computing, virtual environments and information appliances, and traditional media. This is NOT a methods or design course; see TC840 or TC841 for an in-depth treatment those topics. The course is designed around the Erickson & McDonald book (2008), “HCI Remixed: Reflections on Works that have Influenced the HCI Community”, which contains essays written by experts in the field of HCI about published works they found to be influential or inspirational. As such, the book provides an interesting framework from which to critique and explore themes, principles, and trends in the field of HCI over time. Students training to be HCI practitioners will benefit from learning about how similar issues have been approached and solved in different ways as technologies have evolved over time, as well as becoming more aware of where to learn more when faced with a new design problem or situation. Students more interested in conducting research related to HCI will benefit from exposure to a wide range of ideas and contributions in the field, that can serve as a solid foundation for their future work.

**Current Topics in Social Media Research:**
In this PhD-level seminar course we read and critique a selection of very recently published research papers that use different ideological and methodological approaches to understand and explain behavior and usage patterns in large-scale socio-technical systems (also known as “social media” or “social computing” systems). Social media researchers come from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds; therefore, we examine research conducted in the traditions of psychology, economics, communication, library science, sociology, and computer science, among others. Class discussions focus on both the results of the research, and comparisons of the different approaches. Course work includes a literature and research project proposal.

**Online Communities:**
The Internet is a diverse medium for social interaction: business meetings that rely on collaborative software; distance/online learning; email, instant messaging, and chat rooms; social networks, Wikipedia, and social bookmarking; discussion forums and newsgroups; massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) and other social games; and many more. In this undergraduate course, we examine many different venues for online social behavior, focusing on online communities in which groups of people interact with each other over a period of time. Students gain hands-on experience with a variety of tools through in-class demos, presentations, and discussion. Course work included a group research or design project.
