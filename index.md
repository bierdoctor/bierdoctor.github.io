I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Media and Information](http://mi.msu.edu/), of the [College of Communication Arts and Sciences](http://cas.msu.edu/) at [Michigan State University](http://msu.edu/). I also lead the [Behavior, Information and Technology Lab (BITLab)](https://bitlab.cas.msu.edu).

My research program is focused on understanding individual, group, and system level influences on information sharing and privacy in online socio-technical systems. My work is currently funded by NSF awards [CNS-1115926](http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=1115926) and [IIS-1217212](http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1217212), and by an endowment to MSU from AT&T.

My office hours for the **Spring 2015 semester** are Thursdays, 2:30pm-4pm in 420 CAS, or by appointment. On most Fridays you can find me in the BITLab, 251 CAS.
