I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Media and Information](http://mi.msu.edu/), of the [College of Communication Arts and Sciences](http://cas.msu.edu/) at [Michigan State University](http://msu.edu/). I also lead the [Behavior, Information and Technology Lab (BITLab)](https://bitlab.cas.msu.edu).

My research program is focused on understanding interactions and feedback loops between human and algorithm behavior in socio-technical systems that involve user-contributed content and personal data collected automatically by sensors and logs. My work is currently funded by NSF awards [CNS-1115926](http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=1115926) and [IIS-1217212](http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1217212), and by an endowment to MSU from AT&T.

Lately, I have been enjoying spending time thinking about how to measure the influence of personalized content filters like Facebook's News Feed Algorithm on changes in content production and consumption behavior over time, and also how to help users manage the privacy social dilemma that arises when algorithms in ubiquitous computing systems use data collected about others to infer or derive personal information that the users might not want to disclose.

Some keywords to describe my research interests are: algorithmic curation, personalization, information privacy, feedback loops, sociotechnical systems, user-contributed content, human computer interaction

My office hours for the **Spring 2015 semester** are Thursdays, 2:30pm-4pm in 420 CAS, or by appointment. On most Fridays you can find me in the BITLab (251 CAS).
