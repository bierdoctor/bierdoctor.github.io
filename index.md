I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Media and Information](http://mi.msu.edu/), of the [College of Communication Arts and Sciences](http://cas.msu.edu/) at [Michigan State University](http://msu.edu/).

My research program is focused on understanding and finding solutions to problems that arise in sociotechnical systems as they become an increasingly invisible and indispensable part of everyday life. A sociotechnical system involves people, technology, and information; these parts all interact and influence each other, and without all three parts the system would not function as it should. These systems have great potential to help people and improve their lives; however, they also have the potential for harm. 

In particular, I focus on sociotechnical systems that are "black boxes" from the perspective of people using the system---the inputs and outputs can be observed, but the inner workings can't be and are therefore hard for people to reason about. A social dilemma arises when algorithms in ubiquitous computing systems make new inferences from data collected about many, many people. The inferences, or "derived data", can be used to provide beneficial functionality. But, the same data might also be used to infer sensitive personal information about the people using these systems that they might want to keep to themselves. 

Right now, the platforms people use give them few opportunities to learn about, let alone manage, the types of inferences and predictions that systems use their data to make about them, and about other people. This means that people can't even begin to reason about consequences to themselves and others, because they don't have any way of knowing what inferences are possible. In my work, I'm trying to find ways to help people regain some agency with respect to the platforms they use, by creating opportunities for task- and context-appropriate exposure to data and potential inferences. 

My research is currently funded by NSF SaTC award [CNS-1524296](http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1524296), and by an endowment to MSU from AT&T. Some keywords to describe my research interests are: algorithmic curation, personalization, automation, digital privacy, derived data, ubiquitous computing, sociotechnical systems, user-contributed content, and human computer interaction.
