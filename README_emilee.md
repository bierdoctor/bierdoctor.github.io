## TODO

### Now:
specify the image size (for the random headers) in the layout, and it will not move while loading images....
make new images
edit course descriptions; write new copy for PhD HCI course
set up google analytics
write new content for projects, home page

### Later:
work on the site architecture so the layouts make more sense (less redundancy)
