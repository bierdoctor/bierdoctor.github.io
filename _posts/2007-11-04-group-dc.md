Shared file repositories are a type of user-contributed content application
used by workgroups to store and share files online. Their
use in organizations is becoming more frequent; however, repository
users are not always able to effectively find and access information,
especially when files in the repository have been created
and maintained by others. Through field studies involving current
users of shared file repositories, I will document and analyze the
scope and consequences of the problem. In addition, I will test hypotheses
about possible remedies through a series of experiments
exploring the effects of common ground on folder hierarchy and
naming structure, and the ability of users to find and access files in
group information management systems.
