The Access Grid (AG) links geographically separated
people so that they may participate simultaneously in
different types of group activities. This technology shows
clear potential for engendering conditions capable of
supporting true distance collaboration; however, barriers
exist that keep the AG from becoming a communication
medium capable of rivaling face-to-face meetings. This
paper reviews literature from social psychology,
anthropology and computer-supported cooperative work,
suggesting possible reasons for these barriers and
supporting them with evidence from three separate
observations of AG events. Proposed research for
addressing these issues in the coming year is discussed.
