Head-mounted displays for virtual environments facilitate
an immersive experience that seems more real than an
experience provided by a desk-top monitor; however,
the cost of head-mounted displays can prohibit their use.
An empirical study was conducted investigating differences
in spatial knowledge learned for a virtual environment
presented in three viewing conditions: head-mounted
display, large projection screen, and desk-top monitor.
Participants in each condition were asked to reproduce their
cognitive map of a virtual environment, which had been
developed during individual exploration of the
environment along a predetermined course. Error scores
were calculated, indicating the degree to which each
participant's map differed from the actual layout of the
virtual environment. No statistically significant difference
was found between the head-mounted display and large
projection screen conditions. An implication of this result is
that a large projection screen may be an effective,
inexpensive substitute for a head-mounted display.
