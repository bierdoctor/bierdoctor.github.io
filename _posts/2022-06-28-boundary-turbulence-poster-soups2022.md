What informs the disclosure decisions made by early-career scientists when they share their research on social network sites, such as social media? We conducted 14 interviews to investigate how science PhD students in the United States and the Philippines perceive and manage boundary turbulence when they share research-related information online. Through a qualitative analysis that applied Petronio's theory of Communication Privacy Management (CPM) we identify major themes from our interviews. These themes include participants' perceptions of the risks, benefits, and ways of minmizing risks when sharing research-related information on social media. We discuss the implications of these findings for our interviewee population, and connect it to broader implications for stakeholders in science communication and CPM.
