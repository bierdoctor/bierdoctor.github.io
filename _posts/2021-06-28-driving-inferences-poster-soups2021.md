Privacy in sensor-based systems must be studied in the context of lived experiences to understand how behavior may differ from stated preferences. In this study, we showed participants inferences about their driving style that we generated from data about their actual driving behavior, and qualitatively analyzed their reactions. Preliminary findings suggest most participants rationalized the inferences by making them fit within their positive image of their own driving. This suggests that people may find it difficult to conceptualize uses of inferences that run counter to their self-interest, making it hard to make informed privacy choices. We argue that the process for seeking consent for the collection of sensor data should communicate not only how inferences were generated and what they are, but also specifically how they are to be used.
