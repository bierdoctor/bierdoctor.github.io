Phishing emails are scam communications that pretend to be something they are not in order to get people to take actions they otherwise would not. We surveyed a demographically matched sample of 297 people from across the United States and asked them to share their descriptions of a specific experience with a phishing email. Analyzing these experiences, we found that email usersâ€™ experiences detecting phishing messages have many properties in common with how IT experts identify phishing. We also found that email users bring unique knowledge and valuable capabilities to this identification process that neither technical controls nor IT experts have. We suggest that targeting training toward how to use this uniqueness is likely to improve phishing prevention.
