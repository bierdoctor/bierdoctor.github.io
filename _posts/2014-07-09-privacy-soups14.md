Internet companies record data about users as they surf the web,
such as the links they have clicked on, search terms they have used,
and how often they read all the way to the end of an online news
article. This evidence of past behavior is aggregated both across
websites and across individuals, allowing algorithms to make inferences
about users’ habits and personal characteristics. Do users
recognize when their behaviors provision information that may be
used in this way, and is this knowledge associated with concern
about unwanted access to information about themselves they would
prefer not to reveal? In this online experiment, the majority of a
sample of web-savvy users was aware that Internet companies like
Facebook and Google can collect data about their actions on these
websites, such as what links they click on. However, this awareness
was associated with lower likelihood of concern about unwanted
access. Awareness of the potential consequences of data aggregation,
such as Facebook or Google knowing what other websites one
visits or one’s political party affiliation, was associated with greater
likelihood of reporting concern about unwanted access. This suggests
that greater transparency about inferences enabled by data aggregation
might help users associate seemingly innocuous actions
like clicking on a link with what these actions say about them.
