Background: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating disease of intestinal inflammation that primarily affects
premature infants. A potential risk factor for necrotizing enterocolitis is exposure of the premature neonatal intestine to
environmental bacteria and their proinflammatory products such as lipopolysaccharide. The metalloenzyme alkaline
phosphatase (ALP) has been shown to reduce lipopolysaccharide-mediated inflammation. Additionally, premature rat
pups have reduced alkaline phosphatase activity and expression as compared to full term pups. To explore the
possibility that the human premature neonatal intestine has a paucity of alkaline phosphatase activity, we measured
endogenously produced intestinal alkaline phosphatase activity in meconium as a function of gestational age. To test
whether breast milk could serve as a source of exogenous alkaline phosphatase to the neonatal intestine through
ingestion, we measured alkaline phosphatase activity in breast milk across a range of time points post-birth.

Methods: Alkaline phosphatase activity was quantified in 122 meconium samples from infants of gestational
ages ranging from 24 to 40 weeks and in 289 breast milk samples collected from 78 individual mothers
between days 2–49 post-birth.

Results: We observed a strong positive correlation between the meconium alkaline phosphatase activity and
gestational age, with preterm infants having lower meconium alkaline phosphatase activities than early term
or term infants. Breast milk alkaline phosphatase activity was highest in the first week post-birth, with peak
alkaline phosphatase activity at day 2 post-birth, followed by relatively low alkaline phosphatase activity in
weeks 2–7.

Conclusions: Our results are consistent with the two major risk factors for necrotizing enterocolitis
development, preterm birth and lack of breast milk feeding, both contributing to a paucity of alkaline
phosphatase activity and impaired capacity to detoxify proinflammatory bacterial products such as
lipopolysaccharide.
