Understanding how users choose tags can help researchers
better understand how tagging systems can be used and
how to design better tagging systems for the future.
We developed a simulation of del.icio.us, a popular social
bookmarking tool, that allowed us to simulate users
choosing tags using one of four possible strategies for tag
choice found in the literature. We then compared the
resulting tag choices with empirical data retrieved from
del.icio.us to determine which tag choice strategies would
result in choices most similar to those seen in the real
world. We were able to rule out three of the strategies
as unlikely to be the primary means by which tags are
chosen on del.icio.us.
