Group information repositories are systems for storing and
organizing files in a central location all group members can
access. The functionality and capabilities of these systems
are essentially the same as the desktop metaphor of personal
information management (PIM) systems. Using a case study
of a group information repository, I argue that social factors
affect the information structure of the repository, and how it
grows and evolves over time. Users restrict their activities
to files they “own,” are reluctant to delete files that might
be useful to others, dislike the clutter that results, and can
become demotivated if no one views files they uploaded.
