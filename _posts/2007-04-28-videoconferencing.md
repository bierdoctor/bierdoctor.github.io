Video connections can establish a media space in which
games may be played, just as people play games while
collocated. Experiments with participants playing the game
‘Mafia’ indicate that people in a video condition have
similar levels of satisfaction, fun, and frustration, to those
that play while collocated. This finding holds for both those
with prior experience using video systems and those
without, suggesting it is not merely a “novelty effect.”
Results differ about whether there exist differences in focus
of attention, suspicion/trust, and pointing for people playing
the game while using a video system. Implications for both
fun and work uses of video are suggested.
