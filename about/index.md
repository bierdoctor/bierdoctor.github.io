**Bio:**  
I earned my PhD at the University of Michigan’s [School of Information](https://www.si.umich.edu) in 2009. My undergraduate degree is from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I received a Bachelor of Science in [Psychology](http://psych.wisc.edu), and took some programming courses on the side. That experience led to my interest in human-computer interaction, and I also learned some skills that have proven to be incredibly useful for pretty much everything I have done professionally since then.

In 1999 I received a professional master’s degree from Carnegie Mellon’s [Human Computer Interaction Institute](https://www.hcii.cmu.edu), which led to my first-ever conference publication and a trip to [CHI 2000 in the Netherlands](http://www.sigchi.org/chi2000/) to present the paper. In between the HCII and going back to graduate school for the PhD at Michigan, I spent five years working with an interdisciplinary team of researchers at Motorola Labs, designing and evaluating next generation applications for mobile technologies.

From 2009-2011 I worked at Northwestern University, first as a postdoc funded by a Computing Innovation fellowship awarded to me by the Computing Research association and the NSF, and then as a faculty member in the [Department of Communication Studies](http://www.communication.northwestern.edu/departments/communicationstudies). I started my current position as Assistant Professor and AT&T Scholar in the [Department of Media and Information](http://tism.msu.edu) at Michigan State University in the Fall of 2011.

People often ask me about the header photos. I shot most of them with a Sony DSC-RX100 or my iPhone camera, and cropped them for the website. Reload the page if you want to see more; the site chooses a different random photo with every page view.
