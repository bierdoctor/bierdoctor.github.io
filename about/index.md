**Bio:**  
Emilee Rader is an Associate Professor and AT&T Scholar in the [Information School](https://ischool.wisc.edu), which is part of the [School of Computer, Data & Information Sciences](https://cdis.wisc.edu) within the [College of Letters & Science](https://ls.wisc.edu) at University of Wisconsin-Madison. She studies how people reason and make choices about data collection and inferences enabled by digital technologies, to discover new ways to help people create information boundaries and protect themselves from privacy violations. Before joining UW-Madison, she was a faculty member in the [Department of Media and Information](https://comartsci.msu.edu/departments/media-and-information) at Michigan State University. Dr. Rader earned her PhD from the University of Michigan [School of Information](https://www.si.umich.edu) and spent two years at Northwestern University in the [Department of Communication Studies](http://www.communication.northwestern.edu/departments/communicationstudies), where she was a recipient of the highly competitive Computing Innovation post-doctoral fellowship award from the Computing Research Association. She also has a professional Master’s degree from the [Human Computer Interaction Institute](https://www.hcii.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University, and worked with an interdisciplinary team of researchers at Motorola Labs in the early 2000’s designing and evaluating applications for mobile technologies. Her work has been funded by several grants from the National Science Foundation, and she primarily publishes in usable privacy and security and human-computer interaction venues.
