**Bio:**  
I earned my PhD at the University of Michigan’s [School of Information](https://www.si.umich.edu) in 2009. My undergraduate degree is from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I received a Bachelor of Science in [Psychology](http://psych.wisc.edu), and took some programming courses in an attempt to avoid calculus. That experience led to my interest in human-computer interaction, and I also learned some skills that have proven to be incredibly useful for pretty much everything I have done professionally since then.

In 1999 I received a professional master’s degree from Carnegie Mellon’s [Human Computer Interaction Institute](https://www.hcii.cmu.edu), which led to my first-ever conference publication AND trip overseas to present the paper. In between the HCII and going back to graduate school for the PhD at Michigan, I spent five years working with an interdisciplinary team of researchers at Motorola Labs, designing and evaluating next generation applications for mobile technologies.

From 2009-2011 I worked at Northwestern University, first as a postdoc funded by a Computing Innovation fellowship awarded to me by the Computing Research association and the NSF, and then as a faculty member in the [Department of Communication Studies](http://www.communication.northwestern.edu/departments/communicationstudies). I started my current position as Assistant Professor and AT&T Scholar in the [Department of Media and Information](http://tism.msu.edu) at Michigan State University in the fall of 2011. If you’re keeping score, that’s 4 Big Ten schools; if you count my two years as a vocal performance major at Indiana University before transferring to Wisconsin, it’s 5.

**Photos on this site:**  
People often ask me about the header photos. I shot most of them with a Sony DSC-RX100 I have with me pretty much all the time, and subsequently cropped them for the website. A few are actually iPhone photos. Reload the page if you want to see more; the site chooses a different random photo with every page view.
