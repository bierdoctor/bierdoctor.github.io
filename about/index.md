**Bio:**  
I earned my PhD at the University of Michigan’s School of Information in 2009. My undergraduate degree is from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I received a BS in Psychology, and took some programming courses in an attempt to avoid calculus. That experience led to my interest in human-computer interaction, and I also learned some skills that have proven to be incredibly useful for pretty much everything I have done professionally since then.

In 1999 I received a professional master’s degree from Carnegie Mellon’s Human Computer Interaction Institute, which led to my first-ever conference publication AND trip overseas to present the paper. Between CMU and going back to graduate school for the PhD at Michigan, I spent five years working with an interdisciplinary team of researchers at Motorola Labs, designing and evaluating next generation applications for mobile technologies.

From 2009-2011 I worked at Northwestern University, first as a postdoc funded by a Computing Innovation fellowship awarded to me by the Computing Research association and the NSF, and then as a faculty member in the Communication Studies department. I started my current position as Assistant Professor and AT&T Scholar in the TISM department at MSU in the fall of 2011. (If you’re keeping score, that’s 4 Big-10 schools; if you count my two years as a vocal performance major at Indiana University before transferring to Wisconsin, it’s 5.)

In my rare moments of free time, I enjoy hiking in the woods or swimming with my dogs, taking photos of food, and driving around the Midwest in search of new microbrews to sample. I used to make quilts, but haven’t had much time for that lately. And I really hope to find an opportunity to do some singing in the near future (in public, not just by myself in the car).

**Photos on this site:**  
Finally, people often ask me about the photos on each page of the site. I took all of them with a little point-and-shoot camera I have with me pretty much all the time, and subsequently cropped them for the website. Hit “reload” if you want to see more; the site chooses a different random photo with every page view.
