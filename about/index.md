**Bio:**  
Emilee Rader is an Associate Professor and AT&T Scholar in the [Department of Media and Information](http://mi.msu.edu) at Michigan State University. Her research addresses problems that arise at the intersection of people, technology, and information in socio-technical systems. These systems have great potential to help people and improve their lives; however, they also have the potential for harm. In particular, she focuses on socio-technical systems that are “black boxes” from the perspective of people using the system—the inputs and outputs can be observed, but the inner workings are hidden and are therefore hard for people to understand.

Dr. Rader earned her PhD from the University of Michigan [School of Information](https://www.si.umich.edu) and spent two years at Northwestern University in the [Department of Communication Studies](http://www.communication.northwestern.edu/departments/communicationstudies), where she was a recipient of the highly competitive Computing Innovation post-doctoral fellowship award from the Computing Research Association. She also has a professional Master’s degree from the [Human Computer Interaction Institute](https://www.hcii.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University, and worked with an interdisciplinary team of researchers at Motorola Labs in the early 2000’s designing and evaluating applications for mobile technologies. Her work has been funded by several grants from the National Science Foundation, and she primarily publishes in human-computer interaction and usable security and privacy venues.
